# FASCLASS

This contains three files:

-the requirements.txt and main.py files for pulling FASCLASS position descriptions if you have the position description #s you're interested in
-the pulFromPythonAnywhere script for pulling down the resulting XLSX data from my pythonanywhere account, if you have the API key
